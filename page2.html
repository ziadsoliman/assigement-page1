           <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
            
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
            
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997 </p> </td>

           what is the Css?
           CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
           CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
           CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
           External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
       
           Why Use CSS?
       
       CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
       The most common way for people in a department to talk together is in a department meeting, which is the focus of this section, but there are other ways as well. Some time can be saved by settling straightforward matters through e-mail. Conversely, discussing complex issues through email can waste time.

        Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based,
         object-oriented,[15] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended 
         to let application developers "write once,
          run anywhere" (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on 
          all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[18][19][20][21] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[22] Java was originally developed by James Gosling, a Canadian, at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its original features from SmallTalk, with a syntax similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. Java was inspired by C++ with some changes the creators think improve C++.
